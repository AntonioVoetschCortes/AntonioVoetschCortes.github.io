# Me as a pedagogue
## Development
Unlike other competencies where I observed a linear progression, my development in pedagogical competence has been marked by continuous challenges, characterized by numerous ups and downs. Central to these challenges was my struggle to find the right balance between asserting authority and building positive relationships with my students. Establishing good relationships with my students has always been my strength; however, imposing my authority has been more difficult for me.
At the beginning of my time at UniC, I adopted a very strict persona, emphasizing rigid classroom management with strict rules and clear boundaries. However, I soon realized that this approach was not compatible with my natural disposition, which is generally kind and open. This realization marked the beginning of a continuous challenge to find the right balance between being too strict and too lenient. Despite these difficulties, I have gained critical knowledge and skills in this competency.
One key aspect I always emphasize during my lessons is respect. I stress the importance of respect towards the teacher and, more importantly, among classmates. This emphasis on respect was crucial in establishing a safe learning environment for all students. I aimed to extend this respect beyond the classroom, engaging with students in the hallways and showing genuine interest in their well-being, hobbies, and interests.
Inclusivity has also been a significant focus of my development. I ensured that I incorporated all students in my lessons, not just those who actively sought help. This approach was particularly important in classrooms with diverse backgrounds. For example, at UniC, located in a multicultural neighborhood in Utrecht, I taught students of Moroccan, Turkish, and other migrant origins. I learned the importance of adapting my teaching methods and interactions to ensure everyone felt included. I embraced the principle of "equity" over equality, striving to meet each student's unique needs.My experience in Cura√ßao further highlighted the importance of inclusivity. Teaching in a new culture composed of various ethnicities, including Blacks, Latinos, and Chinese, required me to provide an inclusive environment where all students felt valued and supported.
Furthermore, I recognized the importance of fostering the civic development of my students. In our increasingly globalized world, it is crucial to teach students about globalization and what it means to be a globally responsible citizen. For instance, I emphasized the significance of climate change, encouraging students to reflect on its risks and the consequences of their behavior. These examples underscored the importance of pedagogical competence, as I saw my role as an educator extending beyond teaching languages to shaping responsible global citizens.
Significant learning moments often arose from instances where things did not go as planned. For example, dealing with disrespectful behavior towards my mentor, classmates, or myself proved to be valuable learning experiences. These situations challenged me to re-evaluate my approach to conflict resolution and find effective ways to address such conflicts. Understanding and managing group dynamics was a constant process of learning and adaptation.
 Throughout my journey, I have discovered that each country, school, and classroom is unique, requiring teachers to adapt their teaching methods accordingly. The most important aspect of this adaptation is developing meaningful relationships where students feel they can trust you. While challenges in this competence will continue to arise, it is essential to find ways to address them as a competent educator. 
In conclusion, my development in pedagogical competence has been a complex and ongoing journey. Balancing authority and building relationships, emphasizing respect, fostering inclusivity, and promoting civic development are all critical components of this competence. Each experience has contributed to my growth as an educator, preparing me to navigate the diverse and dynamic landscape of teaching. I am committed to continuing this journey, embracing challenges, and striving to become a more effective and empathetic educator.

## ABCD-Reflection: Creating meaningful relationships with students
**A: What happened? What caused it?**

During my internship at UniC, I engaged in several individualized meetings with my students to discuss their progress, not only in English but also in other subjects and their overall development at school. These meetings aimed to give me practical experience in mentoring. As their main English teacher, I used these sessions to address various subjects, their well-being, and ways to overcome challenges. In one particular meeting, a student confided in me about her difficulties with planning and prioritizing tasks (see vide below). According to Shrum (2019), individualized meetings help students learn to expect more of themselves, receive constant and timely feedback and clarification, and manage their academic loads effectively. This framework guided our conversation.

**B: What was important about it?**

The significance of this conversation lay in the student's willingness to open up about her personal struggles. Her trust in me as a teacher was evident, and I was able to offer valuable advice while showing empathy. I emphasized the importance of balancing schoolwork with personal life, encouraging her to make time for hobbies and friends. I advised her to use a calendar to keep track of major tasks, focus on priorities, and not be afraid to say no when necessary. This interaction highlighted the importance of addressing students' holistic development, not just their academic performance. It also demonstrated how individualized meetings could help students manage their academic responsibilities better, set higher expectations for themselves, and benefit from ongoing feedback.
 
**C: What conclusions can you draw from the event?**

The student's enthusiastic response and her acknowledgment that the advice was helpful indicated that the conversation had a positive impact. It was clear that the talk provided her with practical strategies to manage her academic load more effectively and that she felt supported in her challenges. This reinforced the idea that individualized meetings are a powerful tool for student development, helping them to expect more from themselves and manage their academic responsibilities more efficiently. More importantly the incidence serves as evidence that one of my strengths as a pedagogue lays in creating meaningful and trustful relationships with my students.
 
**D: What are you going to do as a result?**

This experience demonstrated my ability to have meaningful one-on-one conversations with students, instilling confidence in them regarding their academic progress and motivating them to improve. It also highlighted my capacity to show empathy in my interactions with students and create good relationships with them. This is also evidenced by feedback received from my mentor at the time, Rafaela Barham (see picture 23), but also by feedback received during my recent internships at Vathorst College and Kolegio Alejandro Paula (see pictures 24, 25 and 26). Moving forward, I will continue to engage in individual meetings with students to support their holistic development and address their personal and academic needs. This approach not only fosters trust but also empowers students to take control of their learning and personal growth. By regularly incorporating these strategies, I aim to help students set higher expectations for themselves, receive continuous feedback, and manage their academic workloads effectively.

## STARR-Reflection: Classroom management during quiz-activity
**Situation:**
During a vocabulary revision session with my second-year French students at Vathorst College Amersfoort, I decided to use a lesson-up quiz to assess their learning. This interactive method was chosen to make the assessment engaging and to quickly verify their vocabulary knowledge. The session took place in our classroom, involving me as the main teacher and all students present, and occurred during a scheduled lesson. 
 
**Task:**
My task was to ensure that students had learned their vocabulary regularly. As the main teacher, I was responsible for checking their knowledge through the quiz. My role included maintaining an orderly and focused classroom environment while conducting the assessment.
I aimed to test vocabulary knowledge interactively and enjoyably using an application my students liked. My expectation was to create a safe and conducive learning environment by setting clear expectations, maintaining eye contact, rewarding good behavior, and ensuring all students remained engaged and on track. I wanted to balance a fun atmosphere with effective learning (Geerts & van Kralingen, 2008).
 
**Action:**
At the start of the quiz, I set clear expectations: students should focus on their own laptops, remain calm, and avoid using any translation tools like Google Translate. During the quiz, I managed disruptions by addressing the behavior immediately. Sometimes, a simple reminder to stay calm sufficed, while other times, I had to explain why certain behaviors were disruptive before moving on. I periodically calmed the class to maintain focus on the quiz, ensuring a balance between enthusiasm and discipline. The following video demonstrates my capacity to maintain a safe and conductive learning environment:

**Results:**
The interruptions indicated that the learning environment was not perfectly focused initially. However, I handled the situation by addressing disruptive behavior and maintaining a positive attitude. Despite the disruptions, I led the quiz enthusiastically, ensuring students remained engaged and the environment conducive to learning. The following feedback received from my supervisor on this lesson confirms my ability to address disruptive behaviour and maintain the focus on the lesson:

**Reflection:**
While the classroom was not completely silent, this does not necessarily indicate a lack of a safe learning environment. Some noise can signify student engagement and natural excitement. This experience demonstrated my ability to manage a classroom effectively, keeping students focused and engaged. It highlighted my capacity to create a positive and productive learning atmosphere, even when challenges arise. This balance of enthusiasm and discipline is crucial for establishing a supportive and dynamic educational environment.

## ABCD-Reflection: Personalized Feedback on learning progress
**A: What happened? What caused it?**

During my internship at Vathorst College Amersfoort, I undertook the task of returning grades to my second-grade HAVO/VWO students for their reading comprehension test and a creative book assignment in French, just before the Christmas break. I used this opportunity to provide personalized feedback on their overall performance in the subject throughout the semester. Despite time constraints, I aimed to engage with each student individually during this single session.

**B: What was important about it?**
Feedback is crucial in education, influencing student achievement significantly.  Effective feedback can help to make the learning of students visible by determining their level of understanding and skill in the subject matter and planning the next steps towards achieving the learning goals (Hattie, 2007). I prioritized delivering personalized, face-to-face feedback to discuss not only grades but also their learning journey and future steps in French. Some students excelled, while others struggled, prompting discussions on how they could improve, including offering resit opportunities and encouraging them to seek assistance from teachers and assistants. I aimed to foster reflection on their learning strategies, particularly during the upcoming holidays. This is evidenced through the following video, in which I interact with one student who excelled and one student receiving an unstatisfactory grade: 

<a href="https://youtu.be/e_wh04X2oEQ" target="_blank">https://youtu.be/e_wh04X2oEQ</a> 

**C: What conclusions can you draw from the event?**

Given more time, I would have liked to delve deeper into individual student challenges and preferences in French. Despite this, I believe I effectively communicated grades and progress, emphasizing empathy and support. It became clear that such personal interactions are invaluable for students, offering insights into their learning progress and fostering a positive learning environment. This example serves as further evidence that one of my strengths lays in establishing good contact with my students and making sure the expectations within the subject are clear. This feedback received by my colleague, Native Speaker Amandine Coutard, accentuates these traits in written form:

![Screenshot (431)](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/ba2f8fab-e120-4d10-9b8f-73655aac6b62)


**D: What are you going to do as a result?**
In the future, I plan to allocate additional time for personalized feedback sessions, possibly sacrificing two lessons to ensure each student benefits from one-on-one discussions. This approach aligns with my commitment to nurturing student development and enhancing their learning experience. Regular feedback moments throughout the school year will be integral to my future teaching practice, reflecting my dedication to pedagogical competence and student-centered learning.
