# Me as a methodology expert
## Development
Before beginning my studies at HU, my familiarity with English and French was strong, yet my understanding of educational methodologies was limited. I lacked theoretical understanding in curriculum organization and didactics aimed at optimizing learning outcomes. My initial internship marked an important learning phase where I absorbed essential teaching practices directly from my experienced mentors. Initially following pre-set curricula and lesson plans, I gradually assumed more responsibility, eventually designing my own lessons and selecting tailored materials. Simultaneously, coursework at Hogeschool Utrecht, especially the Methodology courses, introduced me to innovative didactic methods, notably emphasizing the advantages of communicative language teaching over traditional approaches. This paradigm shift encouraged me to integrate real-life contexts into lessons, nurturing meaningful student engagement and communication—a cornerstone of my evolving methodological philosophy. 
 Advancing through successive methodology courses, I sharpened my ability to create comprehensive lesson series that interconnected across subjects, achieving notable success in Methodology 4. This milestone bolstered my confidence in navigating educational challenges, ensuring I incorporated elements such as constructive alignment between learning objectives, learning activities and summative assessments, formative assessments, and differentiation. The attainment of such skills became evident in subsequent internships, where I created diverse, student-centered lessons tailored to individual interests and learning needs. 
Digital education platforms further broadened my instructional toolkit, offering efficient access to multimedia resources while highlighting challenges like monitoring student engagement. Moreover, a disciplined approach to lesson analysis and evaluation promoted continuous improvement, culminating in the development of a reflective checklist to refine my teaching strategies on a regular basis.  
 Despite encountering  discrepancies between the theoretical knowledge I had acquired at the HU and prevailing practices during my internships, I endeavored to incorporate communicative didactics into my teaching whenever feasible. While acknowledging instances where adherence to existing norms overshadowed innovation, I persisted in applying acquired theories to lesson planning and assessment. 
Additionally, integral to my development was the tracking of student progress, ensuring personalized instruction through formative evaluation and constructive alignment in summative assessments. Regular feedback from peers, mentors and students deepened my understanding of effective teaching strategies and reinforced my commitment to continuous growth in this competence.  
In retrospect, my methodological evolution owes much to the methodology courses at HU and hands-on experiences in diverse educational settings. While navigating the tension between theory and practice, I have emerged with a robust foundation in communicative language teaching and a readiness to exercise autonomy in curriculum design. Looking ahead, I am eager to leverage this expertise to create dynamic, inclusive learning environments that inspire and empower students in their language acquisition journeys. 

## Starr-Reflection: Incorporating formative assessment in my teaching
**Situation**
During my internship at Vathorst College, my French students were tasked with a writing assignment where they had to describe their teachers' personalities. The assignment required students to email their work to me for formative assessment. This task took place during a typical class session, involving all students in the course.
 
**Task**
My responsibility was to instruct the students on how to construct sentences in French, focusing on the proper use of descriptors. This included ensuring correct noun-adjective agreement, verb conjugation, and the use of possessive adjectives, alongside maintaining proper orthography. Personally, I aimed to implement formative assessment techniques I had learned at Hogeschool Utrecht and through seminars at my internship school. Formative assessment is recognized for helping teachers gauge where students are in their learning journey, allowing for instructional adjustments to enhance learning outcomes (Australian Education Research Organisation, 2022). I sought to balance providing beneficial feedback to all students while managing my workload efficiently, as individually correcting each text could be unsustainable.
 
**Action**
To start, I read through all the submitted texts to identify common errors and challenges students faced in writing French. I compiled these observations and sent an email to the class, including an example text for students to compare against their own. Additionally, I provided further explanations during class to clarify the reasons behind the mistakes. Students were then asked to rewrite their texts. Seeking feedback (see feedback, picture 17) from Meike Berben, an educational expert from CPS, I received positive remarks on the visibility of feedback and feedforward elements in my approach. However, I realized that I had omitted a crucial step—reassessing the revised texts to complete the formative assessment cycle. This insight underscored the importance of thorough follow-through in formative assessment.

**Result**
The students appreciated the formative assessment as it provided immediate clarity on their mistakes and the rationale behind them. Although I did not reassess the revised texts in this instance, this experience taught me the necessity of completing the formative assessment cycle, which I incorporated into future assignments. The students' positive reception and expert feedback validated my efforts and encouraged me to refine my approach.
 
**Reflection**
Reflecting on the experience, I was pleased with the positive feedback from both my students and the expert. However, I recognized the importance of including the feedforward step. Moving forward, I ensured this step was integrated into my formative assessments. This experience solidified my understanding of formative assessment, reinforcing its value in preparing students for summative assessments and boosting their confidence. Properly implemented, formative assessment can be effective without overburdening the teacher. This example demonstrates my dedication to applying methodological teaching practices from HU and my commitment to ensuring their effective execution in my teaching.
 Overall, I now fully embrace formative assessment in my teaching practices, confident in its ability to enhance student learning and preparedness for exams. This reflection highlights my continuous effort to integrate and refine methodological strategies to benefit my students.

## ABCD Reflection: Implenting differentiation in my lessons
**A: What happened? What caused it?**

 I aimed to implement differentiation in my French lessons. Differentiation has the potential to stimulate engagement amongst learners and subsequently has also proven to enhance students’ academic performances (Fairbain& Jones-Vo, 2010).  Differentiation can be applied in educational settings through diverse instructional approaches, student grouping, or offering options (Tomlison, 2005). When exploring this didactic strategy in my lessons at Vathorst College, I underwent an important learning progress concerning how I could design my activities so that they are both sufficiently differentiated and motivating for my students. 
 
**B: What was important about it?**

I intended to implement differentiation by dividing activities into three levels: beginner, intermediate, and advanced. I assumed that striving for the most challenging level would be enough motivation. However, after reviewing my students’ work, I found that only a few had attempted the most difficult level. I sought feedback from Meike Berben, an educational consultant at CPS, who provided the following advice:

**C: What conclusions can you draw from the event?**

The event taught me that to better motivate students, tasks could be divided into simple and more challenging exercises, each assigned a value (points or stars) based on difficulty. Students must accumulate a certain number of points or stars to complete the lesson.

**D: What are you going to do as a result?**

Two weeks later, I implemented Meike Berben's advice in a lesson, as highlighted in the following lesson plan (differentiation is highlighted in green). 

**Lesson Plan with differentiation (highlighted in green)**

I observed that most students achieved the required 5 points in the main activity, with many earning all available points. This confirmed that Meike's advice was effective. This lesson example demonstrates how I adjusted my lesson designs to incorporate more differentiation. Feedback from my mentor, Nadia, further highlights my progress in developing this teaching approach in practice (see feedback, picture 21)

## Starr-Reflection: Analyzing and Evaluating my lessons
**Situation**
During my internship at Vathorst, I conducted a self-analysis and realized that I had not been fully engaging in the entire lesson design cycle. According to the learning outcomes, developing lesson plans involves several steps: analyzing, designing, implementing, evaluating, and adjusting. While I had been consistently performing the first three steps, I noticed that I never systematically evaluated my lessons or made adjustments based on those evaluations. This realization prompted me to reflect on my teaching practices and seek ways to improve my lesson planning and execution.
 
**Task**
In the classes where I was the main teacher, I was responsible for planning and delivering lessons that aligned with the learning objectives and curriculum of the school. My primary task was to ensure that these lessons were well-structured, engaging, and effective in promoting student learning.
On a personal level, I aimed to develop my didactic competence, particularly in the areas of lesson planning and execution. I wanted to complete the entire design cycle, which included evaluating my lessons and adjusting my methodologies accordingly. My goal was to identify effective and ineffective lesson activities to continuously improve my lesson designs, thereby enhancing the learning experiences of my students. Ultimately, I sought to develop a personal strategy that would help me systematically evaluate and adjust my lessons.
 
**Action**
To achieve my goal, I undertook several actions. First, I conducted research to understand the key elements of evaluating educational activities. Cambridge (2022) provided a comprehensive overview of the most important aspects of systematically planning, executing, and evaluating lessons. I learned the significance of thorough lesson preparation, setting clear expectations, and obtaining regular feedback from students.
 
I began incorporating short reflections after each lesson, noting what worked well and what needed improvement. Over time, I developed a checklist that included the most critical elements for effective lesson evaluation, based on the theoretical framework I had studied. This checklist became a practical tool that I used consistently to review my lessons.
 
Additionally, I presented the checklist to a colleague for feedback. The colleague offered positive comments and suggested adding a row for "having control over the learning environment" and rephrasing certain elements for clarity (see feedback). I made these adjustments, further refining the checklist to better serve its purpose.

**Results**
The creation and use of the checklist yielded significant results. I received positive feedback from my colleague, who confirmed its practicality and effectiveness. The inclusion of additional elements, based on the colleague's suggestions, enhanced the checklist's comprehensiveness. By regularly using the checklist to reflect on my lessons, I was able to identify areas for improvement and make necessary adjustments.
 
This systematic approach to lesson evaluation and adjustment built my confidence in my teaching abilities. I became more aware of the importance of critically assessing my teaching methods to enhance student learning. The practical tool I developed has become an integral part of my teaching practice, enabling me to continuously improve my lesson plans and delivery.
 
**Reflection**
Reflecting on this experience, I am pleased with the progress I have made in developing my didactic competence. The systematic evaluation and adjustment of my lessons have significantly improved my teaching effectiveness. I am now more confident in my ability to plan, analyze, evaluate, and adjust my lessons to meet the needs of my students.
 
The positive feedback from my mentor and colleague confirms the value of the checklist and the importance of self-reflection in teaching. Moving forward, I will continue to use the checklist and seek feedback to refine my teaching strategies. Continuous professional development is essential to maintaining and enhancing my teaching effectiveness, ensuring that my students benefit from a well-rounded and engaging learning experience. This experience has been transformative, equipping me with the skills and confidence to be a more effective educator
