# Me as a subject expert
## Development 
After four years of intensive study in French and English at Hogeschool Utrecht, coupled with diverse practical experiences during my internships, I can confidently assert that I am a competent teacher who has mastered both subjects' knowledge and skills. My journey to achieve this level of expertise has been marked by a lifelong passion for languages, nurtured by growing up with German and Spanish at home and demonstrating a natural aptitude for English and French at school.  

My proficiency in French was evident early on, earning recognition in Germany for outstanding performance in French upon completing high school. I actively maintained and enhanced my French skills through initiatives like a school exchange program in France and continuous tutoring. Similarly, my strong foundation in English, supported by familial interactions in Los Angeles and academic success, was further developed in an international student environment during my studies. Integral to my language mastery were also my stay abroad experiences. I engaged in immersive trips such as working on a farm in France and participating in the educational immersion program in Lille, which deepened my understanding of French culture and language. Similarly, my time in Los Angeles enriched my appreciation for American culture and English language.  

I also want to highlight the crucial role that the courses at Hogeschool Utrecht played in enhancing my understanding and proficiency in both subjects. Courses such as "compétences linguistiques" trained us to use the French language both orally and in written form, achieving levels B2+ to C1. In "fonctionnement de la langue," we delved into French grammar, phonetics, and linguistics. "Le Monde Francophone" expanded our cultural and intercultural competence regarding French-speaking countries worldwide. The "Histoire et Littérature" courses offered deep insights into the literature and history of the French-speaking world. Similarly, English courses for “Writing” and “Speaking” enabled me to reach C2 level proficiency in both written and oral communication. The culture courses improved my cultural and intercultural competence related to the extensive English-speaking world. Additionally, the English literature courses provided a comprehensive understanding of short stories, youth literature, poems, novels, and all the essential elements necessary for a secondary education English teacher.  

Furthermore, I was lucky to be offered a job at my first internship school UniC at as a teacher assisstant for a French teacher in the “bovenbouw”. I engaged in practical roles, such as assisting in French classes and preparing students for their final exams. This provided invaluable insights into the Dutch educational system's language requirements and curriculum objectives and gave me a clearer sense of direction as to what end goal my lessons were aiming at. Understanding these core educational objectives was also facilitated by my methodology courses and hands-on experiences in my internships. I learned to align my lesson plans with national curriculum guidelines and adapt teaching methods to meet diverse student needs, whether preparing VWO students for rigorous text analysis or engaging HAVO students with practical language applications.  

A significant challenge I faced was instilling the importance of French language proficiency among students, contrasting with the inherent global relevance of English. I endeavored to illustrate French's cultural and practical significance, showcasing its global reach and historical importance within Europe, though this remains an ongoing challenge.  

In conclusion, my journey to expertise in French and English has been driven by a lifelong passion, enriched by academic rigor, practical experiences, and cultural immersion. I now possess a comprehensive mastery of language skills, literature, and cultural nuances, informed by a deep understanding of educational objectives and curriculum alignment. As I continue my teaching career, I am committed to overcoming challenges and ensuring students understand the enduring value of language education.

## STARR-Reflection: Storytelling and connections to real-life as evidence for my enthusiasm for the subject French
**Situation** 

The situation was the following: I was teaching French to third-year VWO students at Vathorst College. My classes were preparing for a so-called "taaldoorp" that we organized, where they had to demonstrate that they are capable of having basic everyday conversations in French. We organized it in such a way that the "taaldoorp" consists of several stations with different topics, each having an end goal in mind. For example, they had to know how to reserve a spot at a camping site, ask for information in a tourist office, ask for directions in a city, order food in a restaurant, or talk with a vendor at a clothing shop. I was the main teacher in the class and took the initiative to organize the preparation towards this "taaldoorp".  

**Task:**

My task was to prepare students for these conversational exercises in French and familiarize them with various language structures. As the main teacher, my role involved facilitating guidance and instructions to ensure students engaged effectively in these conversations. I was responsible for leading the lesson, ensuring productive learning, and motivating students to actively participate in French-speaking activities and enhance their overall communication skills. The expectation was to conduct the lesson in a manner that would foster student engagement, encourage language practice, and prepare them adequately for the "taaldoorp" assessment.  

Personally, I aimed to demonstrate the relevance of French language skills beyond the classroom. I wanted students to realize that proficiency in these conversations could empower them to navigate everyday situations while traveling in French-speaking countries. I expected myself to deliver an engaging lesson that would inspire students' interest in French, showcasing the practical applications of the language and establishing a deeper appreciation for cultural understanding.  

**Action:**  

In alignment with research findings from Harvard University (n.d.) and the British Council (n.d.), which highlight the effectiveness of real-life connections and storytelling in education, I incorporated personal experiences from my recent trip to France. As the subsequent PowerPoint Presentation shows,  I shared anecdotes, showed photos, and connected these experiences to the vocabulary and conversational skills students were learning for their "taaldoorp" exercises. During the lesson, I engaged students with a narrative about my trip, prompted discussion using comprehension questions, and linked the experience to relevant language concepts. Students responded with enthusiasm, actively participating, asking questions, and demonstrating a keen interest in the topic. Afterwards, I facilitated practice sessions where students applied the learned conversations themselves. I provided personalized feedback, encouraging their language development and reinforcing their confidence in speaking French.  

**Results:**  

The lesson concluded with high engagement levels and evident motivation among students to improve their French communication skills. Feedback from both my mentor and students was overwhelmingly positive. My mentor praised my ability to make the subject engaging and relevant, contributing to effective learning outcomes. The following feedback received from my mentor (marked in yellow) confirms my enthusiasm for the subject French:
