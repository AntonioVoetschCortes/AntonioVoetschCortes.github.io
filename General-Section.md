## Vision of education and subject area 
My decision to become a teacher crystallized during my gap year in Ecuador following high school in Germany. Uncertain about my future career path, I sought a meaningful experience to broaden my perspectives. Through the "weltwärts" program, financially supported by the German government and facilitated by via.ev, I volunteered in Quito with an NGO. The contrast between the modern, digitalized schools in Germany and the dilapidated conditions in Ecuador profoundly impacted me. Despite the challenges—outdated facilities, heavy workloads, and language barriers—the experience was immensely rewarding. Witnessing firsthand the transformative power of education on children from underprivileged backgrounds, I realized my calling.  

Upon returning to Germany, I pursued studies at the University of Applied Sciences Utrecht, focusing on English and French education. Both languages held personal significance—English for its global utility and French for its cultural resonance and personal connections from school exchanges. Studying these languages deepened my appreciation for their historical and cultural contexts, despite acknowledging the darker aspects of their global spread due to colonialism.  

My teaching philosophy evolved significantly from the Grammar-translated method I experienced in Germany to embracing the communicative approach. This shift, discovered during my studies at HU, emphasizes practical language use and authentic communication over rote memorization. I believe in integrating grammar and orthography while making lessons engaging and adaptable to students' interests and ages. Inspired by progressive educational models like those at UniC Utrecht and Vathorst College Amersfoort, I advocate for a supportive role that empowers students to take ownership of their learning paths.  

Transparency is crucial in my teaching approach—I strive to clearly outline learning objectives, exercises, and evaluation criteria, ensuring accessibility of materials and my availability for student support. Moreover, my goal extends beyond language proficiency; I aim to cultivate independent learners who are culturally sensitive and prepared for a globalized world. Encouraging intercultural understanding and establishing a respectful learning environment are fundamental to my teaching philosophy.  

In essence, my journey to becoming a language teacher stems from a passion for languages and a commitment to nurturing socially adept global citizens. By leading by example and instilling values of respect and tolerance, I aspire to make a positive impact on students' lives beyond the classroom. 

## Reflection on and justification of decisions within studies
My studies have been marked by numerous learning moments and decisions, each contributing to maximizing the value of my education. In daily life, I made countless smaller decisions to streamline my studies, manage my internships, and balance my personal life. This involved creating effective routines, selecting project partners, identifying resources for questions, and handling personal challenges. However, three major decisions significantly influenced my academic journey, and I will reflect on these decisions, substantiating them with relevant literature.  

The first significant decision was to learn Dutch. Knowing I would be in the Netherlands for at least four years, acquiring the local language was essential for building connections and establishing a network. This decision also greatly benefited my internships. According to Dilyoan (2017), “Effective communication helps people learn easier, strengthens the relationship between the teacher and the learner, and creates a positive atmosphere in the learning environment.” While the ultimate goal as a language teacher is to communicate in the target language, my understanding of Dutch improved communication, especially in my French classes where students struggled more. Speaking Dutch allowed me to instruct students effectively, maintain good relationships, understand student interactions, and intervene when necessary. Additionally, it facilitated communication with my Dutch colleagues, enhancing team problem-solving as noted by Yow and Lim (2017). Despite initial challenges, my familiarity with German, which resembles Dutch, helped me achieve a communicative level of B1, with some B2 proficiency. This decision was essential in integrating into the school environment and participating fully in various school activities.  

Another important decision was my specialization choice: General Secondary Education Stream over the vocational stream. This choice aligned with my background in Germany, where I was accustomed to a similar educational track. I preferred teaching in a context where subject mastery was emphasized over classroom management. Although vocational students are not less intelligent, they tend to be less language-oriented and more practice-focused (Groeneveld, Benschop & Olvers, 2010). My PD mentor confirmed that vocational streams require more classroom management, reinforcing my decision to focus on secondary education. This path allowed me to delve into the methodology behind language teaching and apply it in a more academically challenging environment.  

Deciding where to do my internships was also crucial. According to Cassandra, a good internship is vital as it helps students learn beyond the classroom, explore career options, develop a portfolio, network, and cultivate soft skills (The Washinton Center, 2020). My first internship at UniC appealed to me due to its pedagogical vision based on uniqueness, connectedness, and independence. This philosophy resonated with my values, emphasizing the development of independent, respectful, and self-sufficient learners. Meeting a French teacher at UniC who also taught at Vathorst College, I decided to join her there for my second internship. Vathorst College's vision aligned with UniC’s, granting students independence and freedom, which greatly influenced my teaching style.   

For my final internship, I chose Kolegio Alejandro Paula in Curaçao, facilitated by an agency. This decision was motivated by a desire for international experience, as research suggests that studying abroad enhances employability, resilience, problem-solving skills, and cultural intelligence (Genkova & Kruse, 2020). Initially, I wanted to go to a French-speaking country to improve my French skills, but health issues required multiple surgeries in Germany, altering my plans. The PD4B internship can only be completed at a school within the Dutch educational system. Consequently, I chose the Dutch Caribbean Islands to gain experience in a less developed country and test my adaptability to new environments.  

In conclusion, these major decisions during my studies—learning Dutch, specializing in secondary education, and selecting impactful internships—have significantly shaped my educational journey and teaching philosophy. Each decision was driven by a desire to enhance my skills, integrate into the local culture, and prepare for a fulfilling teaching career.
